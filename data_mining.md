#Data Mining Algorithms Assignment

The algorithm I read about was the Support Vector Machines algorithm. 

It solves for anomoly detection, as well as classification and regression

What does it do? It models large data sets with data points that may have several attributes and finds the outliers or data points that are inconsistent with the "typical" data point. As I understand it, it uses data that's binary -- so each attribute has to be one of two choices It allows you to define how "different" a data point needs to be to be considered an anomoly. 

As the overview pointed out, this can be used to identify fraud in certain cases where there is a large sample set/population. 

In the context of my work in analyzing financial data for colleges, I think it could be used to figure out which schools may have entered an incorrect endowment per student figure by analyzing consistency with variables such as whether it's a public or private college, whether it's an ivy league or non-ivy league school, whether it's a research or non-reasearch college, etc.  

In the conetxt of analyzing pay of executives, another thing I'm working on at work, it could be used to figure out which CEOs are being compensated out side of the norm associated with other companies of comparable size or sector. Or the outliers in terms of a profit-to-pay ratio.
